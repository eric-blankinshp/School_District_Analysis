# School_District_Analysis
## Project overview
My boss has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once I replaced the math and reading scores, I need to repeat the school district analysis that I did in the module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

#  Replace the reading and math scores.
# Step 1. Import numpy as np.
# Step 2. Use the loc method on the student_data_df to select all the reading scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School and replace them with NaN.
# Step 3. Refactor the code in Step 2 to replace the math scores with NaN.

# Repeat the school district analysis

# Step 1. Get the number of students that are in ninth grade at Thomas High School.
# Step 2. Subtract the number of students that are in ninth grade at 
# Step 3. Calculate the passing percentages with the new total student count.
# Step 4.Calculate the overall passing percentage with new total student count.
# Step 5.  Get the number of 10th-12th graders from Thomas High School (THS).
# Step 6. Get all the students passing math from THS
# Step 7. Get all the students passing reading from THS
# Step 7a. Get all the students passing math from THS
# Step 8. Get all the students passing math and reading from THS
# Step 9. Calculate the percentage of 10th-12th grade students passing math from Thomas High School. 
# Step 10. Calculate the percentage of 10th-12th grade students passing reading from Thomas High School.
# Step 11. Calculate the overall passing percentage of 10th-12th grade from Thomas High School.
# Step 12. Replace the passing math percent for Thomas High School in the per_school_summary_df.
# Step 13. Replace the passing reading percentage for Thomas High School in the per_school_summary_df.
# Step 14. Replace the overall passing percentage for Thomas High School in the per_school_summary_df.
